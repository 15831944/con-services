Glossary

1.	SubGrid : A structure that stores a square section of a much larger grid.
    The larger grid is an aggregate of the sub grids it contains.
2.	Cell : An entry in the list of references contained in a sub-grid. A cell
    may be a reference to another sub grid, a reference to a totally different
    class of object, or be null.
3.	‘On-the-ground cell’: A cell whose purpose is to record information about
    a single ‘grid cell’. Eg: The height, or radio latency, or Caterpillar
    CompactionValue etc recorded for a specific place (grid cell) in the site.
    These values may be singular in the case of information supplied to a client
    to fulfill a request, or many valued in the case of the processed machine
    pass history for the cell. The extents of a grid cell is defined as 1 foot
    square (Imperial) or 250mm square (Metric)

Overview

This structure is tended to provide the following capabilities:

1.	Spatial index through which any designated on-the-ground grid cell may be
    located in no more than 6 steps (ie: O(6)). On-the-ground cells are thought
    of as entities that live in a virtual integer coordinate space where the extents
    of the cell is represented by an integer quantity (either [X, Y] grid location
    or bit interleaved liner index etc). Index is capable of uniquely identifying,
    indexing, locating and storing approximately 1 sextillion cells in the grid
    (that’s 1 followed by 18 zeros -> 1,000,000,000,000,000,000).
2.	Storage of the following on an on-the-ground cell basis
    a.	Single processed value
        eg: Fully processed machine pass, or single attribute information from a fully processed machine pass.
    b.	Complete machine pass history
        ie: List of fully processed machine passes
3.	Provide caching support
    Sub-grids containing on-the-ground cell arrays may be held on disk,
    or in-memory. If the on-the-ground sub-grid is cached, then its reference
    in the grid cells is non-null. This caching is necessary due to the data
    volumes involved.
4.	Provide consistent structure that both client and server sides may use to
    represent, store and search the IC spatial data.
5.	Provides level of detail inherent in layered nature of structure.
    A client requesting display data can determine which level of the grid they
    should request data from. Sub grids can maintain a representative value for
    this purpose.

This sub grid tree is not aware of the structured or storage mechanism used for
the bottom leaf nodes (ie: the nodes containing the actual cell data). Thus, the
access mechanisms chiefly revolve around sub-grids, rather than actual cells
themselves, apart from cell X/Y location references used to locate sub grids.
