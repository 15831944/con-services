This directory contains the control scripts for ignite.

These are extracted from the /bin directory for the same release of ignite trex is using. (https://ignite.apache.org/download.cgi#sources)
These are included this way as they are not distributed with the nuget package.
See following links for info on how to use control scripts. 

https://apacheignite.readme.io/docs/baseline-topology
https://apacheignite-tools.readme.io/docs/control-script

When using these scripts you need to supply the --host IP_ADDRESS of a node on the grid you are wanting to connect to.
