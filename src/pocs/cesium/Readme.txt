To run demo go to cesium website and download latest source code and follow setup guide for node
https://cesiumjs.org/downloads/

https://cesiumjs.org/tutorials/Cesium-Workshop/#setup

I was using Cesium-1.51
Once you have this folder extracted and you have run the setup scripts place the folder VSSApps in the cesium root folder.
Start node server. e.g. node server.js
then run either VSS3DMap.html for 3d or VSS2DMap.html for 2d view.
e.g. http://localhost:8080/VSSApps/VSS3DMap.html
