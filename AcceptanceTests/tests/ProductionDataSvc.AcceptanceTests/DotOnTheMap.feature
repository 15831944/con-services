@ignore
Scenario: DotOnTheMap - Track a Machine
	Given the Tag service URI "/api/v1/tagfiles", Tag request repo file "DotOnTheMapRequest.json"
		And the Machine service URI "/api/v1/projects/1001210/machines/", Machine result repo file "DotOnTheMapResponse.json"
	When I post Tag file "FirstDot" from the Tag request repo
		And I get and save the machine detail in one place
		And I post Tag file "SecondDot" from the Tag request repo
		And I get and save the machine detail in another place
	Then the first saved machine detail should match "FirstDot" result from the Machine result repo
		And the second saved machine detail should match "SecondDot" result from the Machine result repo
