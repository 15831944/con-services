Feature: EditData
	I should be able to do and undo machine design and layer edits.

Background: 
	Given the edit data service URI "/api/v1/productiondata/edit" 
		And the get edit data service URI "/api/v1/productiondata/getedits"
		And all data edits are cleared for project 1001285
		#And GetLifts service "/api/v1/projects/{0}/liftids" only returns 13 real lifts for project 1001285
		#And GetMachineDesign service "/api/v1/projects/{0}/machinedesigns" only returns 3 real designs for project 1285
		And the following data edit details
