This tool allows you to undo checked out tag files.
It requires the TCC credentials of the VisionLink user who owns the tag files.
These can be found in the ExternalUser table in the NH_OP database in current gen.
When you run the tool enter the credentials and click the Go button.
Some logging information will be displayed in the form.
A log called TagFileUtility.log will also be created in c:\temp with more detailed information.
